# add-user-profile-button

**Add button to user card and user profile **

Add a button to the user card and user profile under the other buttons (e.g., "Message", "Chat", etc...) unless the user is in the group specified in the "Exempt Group" theme setting.

The Button Text is customizable in the Theme Settings.

Clicking the button takes the user to the URL in the Button URL theme setting.

The intended use case is to notify users who click on a user profile that if only they were members of the Exempt Group (that hides the button) that they would be able to send PMs, but since the button display is triggered by the Group membership rather than whether the user can send PMs, it can be used for other purposes.

Note that users who can send PMs but are not members of the Exempt Group will see both the Message button and the button added by this theme component.

The button will also show for anonymous (not logged in) users.

Thanks to the [Grey Arrows Drone Club](https://greyarro.ws/) for funding development of this theme component.
